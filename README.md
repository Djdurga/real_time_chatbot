# 💬 Real-Time Chatbot using Python (Terminal + GUI)

This project is a simple yet powerful real-time chat application built using **Python's socket programming** and **threading**. It supports both **terminal-based clients** and a **desktop GUI** made with **Tkinter**. The server can handle multiple clients chatting simultaneously in real time.
